# Kaggle M5 Forecasting Accuracy 2020
**_Background_**
***
The repository contains my team's solution to the [5th Makridakis Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) (i.e., M5) held on Kaggle between March 2 and June 30, 2020. Check out my [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/mwong007)!

**_How to Run_**
***
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/mingjiewong/Kaggle-M5-Forecasting-Accuracy-2020.git && cd Kaggle-M5-Forecasting-Accuracy-2020
```

Download raw data from Kaggle at ```https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data``` and extract it:
```
mkdir {path-to-dir}/Kaggle-M5-Forecasting-Accuracy-2020/datasets
cd {path-to-dir}/Kaggle-M5-Forecasting-Accuracy-2020/datasets
unzip m5-forecasting-accuracy.zip
```

Install dependencies using **python 3.6+**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A jupyter notebook for visualizing the steps is at ```Kaggle-M5-Forecasting-Accuracy-2020/m5-forecasting-cnn-lstm-deep-learning.ipynb```. To launch notebook:
```
jupyter notebook m5-forecasting-cnn-lstm-deep-learning.ipynb
```
